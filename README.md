Participating in the [#HacktoberFest2021](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)

## What is Hacktoberfest ?

Hacktoberfest, in its 8th year, is a month-long celebration of open source software run by DigitalOcean, Appwrite, Intel and Deepsource. It consists of challenges that encourages people to contribute to any open source projects. Through this event, we hope to contribute, learn and grow together in the Open-source by participating in Hactoberfest 2021.

## What is Open Source ?

Open source refers to source code that is publicly accessible and allows anyone to inspect, modify or learn from it. Open source projects encourage collaboration and the freedom to use the software for any purpose you wish.
